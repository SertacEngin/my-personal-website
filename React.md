React is a Javascript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is the most used Javascript library for front end development.

When a web page is loaded in a browser the browser takes the HTML code and creates a tree-like structure called the Document Object Model (DOM). This allows us to use JavaScript and change the page content and response to user actions. For example we can use JavaScript to hide an element when a button is clicked. This is called vanilla JavasScript meaning plain JavaScript code without any third party tools. As our applications grow working with a DOM can become quite complex and challenging to manage. This is where React comes into play. With react we no longer need to worry about querying and updating DOM elements. Instead we work with small reuseable components and React will take care of efficiently creating and updating DOM elements. So components help us write reusable, modular and better code.

Essentially a React application is a tree of components with the app being the root bringing everything together.
