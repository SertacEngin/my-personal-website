🧠 What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is now the most widely used library for front-end development.
🌐 DOM & Vanilla JavaScript

When a webpage loads, the browser parses HTML into a Document Object Model (DOM) — a tree-like structure. Using vanilla JavaScript (plain JS without libraries), we can manipulate this DOM, such as showing/hiding elements. But as apps grow, direct DOM manipulation becomes error-prone and hard to manage.
🧩 Why React?

React abstracts away direct DOM manipulation by letting us create components — small, reusable UI blocks. React manages updating and rendering efficiently through a virtual DOM. A React app is essentially a tree of components, with the App component at the root.
⚙️ Creating a React App

There are two popular ways to scaffold a new React project:
1. Create React App (CRA) – Official but slower.
2. Vite – Modern, faster bundler. Preferred nowadays.
