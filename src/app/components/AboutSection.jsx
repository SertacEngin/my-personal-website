            Hi, I&apos;m a passionate IT enthusiast with a strong foundation and a growing specialization in cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and IT automation.<br /><br />

After completing my Master&apos;s in Electrical Engineering and IT with a focus on automation, I started my professional journey as a software engineer at congatec GmbH. There, I developed and tested low-level firmware solutions and diagnostic tools, gaining valuable experience with Python, Linux, and systems programming.<br /><br />

Over time, I discovered a deeper interest in scalable and resilient IT infrastructures. To pursue this direction, I independently upskilled in AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, and CI/CD practices. I earned the AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate certification and began applying these skills to personal projects and automated workflows.<br /><br />

I thrive in environments where automation, observability, and collaboration come together to create efficient and reliable systems. I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and being part of communities that value openness and growth.<br /><br />

Currently, I&apos;m looking to deepen my expertise in DevOps engineering, with a special interest in cloud-native tools, infrastructure as code, and modern data center solutions.
